# Replication of the 'Madagascar's biggest mine is on track to achieve No Net Loss of Forest' paper
This repository contains code and input data used in to replicate the results  found in the paper 'Madagascar's biggest mine is on track to achieve No Net Loss of Forest' by Katie Devenish, Sebastien Desbureaux, Simon Willcock and Julia PG Jones.

This project was a part of the Gottingen Replication Games 2025, by i4replication. 

The original scripts and data can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/katie-devs/Biodiversity_offset_effectiveness/tree/main).

# Folders Description

- 1-Replication_scripts

	This folder holds the altered scripts to run the replication. It changes the paths from the local folder to an online repository, and install some missing libraries found on the original project.

- 2-Extended_data_analysis

	This folder holds the scripts used for the extended analysis the replicators did to investigate if the results of the study would alter if more years were added to the dataset (Global Forest Watch dataset up until 2023) or if the dataset was swithched for another one (Tropical Moist Forests dataset).

- 3-Bootstrapping_Robustness_Check

	This folder holds the scripts used for the uncertainty robusteness check. This was used by the replicators to investigate if adding uncertainty by bootstrapping the results would alter the analysis.
	
- 4-
	
	This folder holds the scripts used for the count data transformation robusteness check. This was used to see if different transformations of the original data could alter the results.
	
- 5-Miscellaneous
	
	This folder holds the scripts used by the replicators to help better understand the data.
